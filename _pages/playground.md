This website provides insights into AI policy. It is not intended to be comprehensive, but to provide a few examples of the many issues that arise in the development of AI.

The site is organized into three sections:

- The first section, AI Policy Issues, provides a list of issues that arise in the development of AI.
- The second section, AI Policy Solutions, provides a list of solutions to the issues.
- The third section, AI Policy Frameworks, provides a list of frameworks that can be used to address the issues.

The site is a work in progress. It is intended to be a living document that will be updated as new issues arise and new solutions are developed. The site is intended to be a resource for policymakers, researchers, and the general public. The site is not intended to be comprehensive. It is intended to provide a few examples of the many issues that arise in the development of AI.


## AI Policy Issues

This section, **AI Policy Issues**, provides a list of issues that arise in the development of AI. These issues are not necessarily technical issues, but rather issues that arise in the development of AI.
- The first issue is the problem of **defining AI**. The term AI is used in many different ways, and it is not always clear what is meant by the term. This is a problem because it makes it difficult to communicate about AI.
- The second issue is the problem of **AI failure**. If AI systems are to be used in critical applications, then it is important that they work correctly. If they do not, then there could be serious consequences.
- The third issue is the problem of **AI control**. If AI systems are to be used in critical applications, then it is important that they are under the control of some person or organization. It is also important that these people or organizations are trustworthy.
- The fourth issue is the problem of **AI safety**. The development of AI systems brings with it the possibility that these systems will develop to the point where they can harm humans. It is important to develop AI systems in such a way that this possibility is minimized.
- The fifth issue is the problem of **AI arms races**. If AI systems are developed, then countries will want to develop AI systems that are better than other countries' AI systems. This could lead to an arms race in which AI systems are improved as fast as possible.


## AI Policy Solutions
This section, **AI Policy Solutions**, provides a list of solutions to the issues. The solutions are divided into two categories, short term and long term. The short term solutions are the ones that can be implemented in the next few years. Long term solutions are solutions that can be implemented beyond the next five years.

The solutions are not mutually exclusive. Many of them are complementary to each other.

### Short Term Solutions

The short term goals of AI Policy Solutions are:

- To prevent the negative consequences of AI on the society.
- To ensure that AI is beneficial to people and society.
- To ensure that AI is transparent and accountable.
- To ensure that AI is safe.
- To ensure that AI is robust and reliable.
- To ensure that AI is explainable.

### Long Term Solutions

- Global Governance: The international community needs to develop a proper understanding of AI as a global phenomenon. The international community needs to develop a framework for global governance of AI.

- International Norms: The international community needs to develop international norms for the use of AI.

- International Framework: The international community needs to develop an international framework for the development of AI.

- International Standards: The international community needs to develop international standards for the development of AI.

## AI Policy Frameworks
This section, **AI Policy Frameworks**, provides a list of frameworks that can be used to address the issues. These frameworks can be used to guide research and development work and to provide a common language and framework for discussion and debate.

The list of frameworks is drawn from the AI policy literature and the authors’ own research. The frameworks are not intended to be prescriptive, but rather to provide a common language and framework for discussion and debate.

The frameworks are organized along the following dimensions:

- Scope - the scope of the framework, whether it is intended to be global or local, or whether it is intended to be applicable to all AI systems or only to specific classes of AI systems; including the topics it covers, the level of detail it provides, and the level of abstraction it uses;
  - The framework should be broad enough to be useful, but narrow enough to be tractable.
  - The framework should be flexible enough to accommodate the different needs of different stakeholders, and to allow them to use it in a way that is most appropriate for their purposes.
- Focus - the focus of the framework, including whether it is primarily descriptive, normative, or evaluative;
  - Descriptive frameworks are intended to describe the current state of affairs, and to provide a common language and framework for discussion and debate.
  - Normative frameworks are intended to provide guidance on how to change the current state of affairs, and to provide a common language and framework for discussion and debate.
  - Evaluative frameworks are intended to provide a common language and framework for discussion and debate, but also to provide a means of assessing the potential impact of a given policy on the state of affairs.
- Approach - the approach to the framework, including whether it is primarily based on principles, guidelines, or scenarios;
  - Principles are high-level statements that are intended to be used as a basis for decision-making.
  - Guidelines are statements that are intended to be used as a basis for decision-making.
  - Scenarios are descriptions of possible future situations that are intended to be used as a basis for decision-making.
- Structure - the structure of the framework, including whether it is primarily top-down or bottom-up, and whether it is primarily linear or iterative;
  - The top-down and linear frameworks are more likely to be used by policy makers and regulators, whereas the bottom-up and iterative frameworks are more likely to be used by developers and designers.
- Method - the method used to develop the framework, including whether it is primarily based on expert opinion or on empirical data;
  - Expert opinion is based on the opinions of experts in the field, while empirical data is based on data collected from the real world.
- Content - the content of the framework, including whether it is primarily based on specific issues, specific technologies, or a combination of both;
  -  It is also important to consider whether the framework is primarily targeted at the development of policies and regulations, or whether it is intended to be used as a tool for public education and awareness.
- Relation - the relation of the framework to other frameworks and to other policy issues; and
- Other - any other aspects of the framework that are relevant to its use.
