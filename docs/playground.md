'Disclaimer: The following contents have been generated by OpenAI's GPT-3 model. It has been fed with the input "This website provides insights about AI policy." - the rest was the work of the davinci engine at temperatures 0.25-0.5Â° and a response length of 600. Occasionally, some suggestions have been disregarded and the prompt was re-executed. The layout and minor editing was done manually by a human (_= me_).'

This website provides insights about AI policy. It is not intended to be comprehensive, but to provide a few examples of the many issues that arise in the development of AI.

The site is organized into three sections:

- The first section, AI Policy Issues, provides a list of issues that arise in the development of AI.
- The second section, AI Policy Solutions, provides a list of solutions to the issues.
- The third section, AI Policy Frameworks, provides a list of frameworks that can be used to address the issues.

The site is a work in progress. It is intended to be a living document that will be updated as new issues arise and new solutions are developed. The site is intended to be a resource for policymakers, researchers, and the general public. The site is not intended to be comprehensive. It is intended to provide a few examples of the many issues that arise in the development of AI
