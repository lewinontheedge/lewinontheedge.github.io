    excerpt: "The European Commission is one of the most central bodies in EU politics, boasting a workforce of over 32,000 civil servants. However, it suffers from a diversity gap when it comes to the representativeness of its staff across many key dimensions."

I am a PhD candidate in political science and international relations at [Pompeu Fabra University](https://www.upf.edu/web/phd-political-and-social-sciences/){:target="_blank"}. I am also a predoctoral research fellow at the [Institut Barcelona d'Estudis Internacionals](http://ibei.org/){:target="_blank"} (IBEI). There, I am working for [GLOBE](https://www.globe-project.eu/){:target="_blank"}, an exciting Horizon 2020 project on "Global Governance and the European Union: Future Trends and Scenarios".

My research interests lie at the intersection of global governance and AI ethics, with a special focus on EU foreign policy. My PhD supervisor is [Jacint Jordana](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=IQLfIgMAAAAJ&hl=en){:target="_blank"}.

From a methodological point of view, I am curious about the use of computational methods in IR and political science. In particular, I enjoy learning more about text mining, NPL and machine learning techniques.

You can follow me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/lewinontheedge){:target="_blank"} or [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/lewin-schmitt/){:target="_blank"}. You can also reach out via [email](mailto:lewin.schmitt@upf.edu). If I don't respond to an inquiry immediately, I'm likely playing volleyball at the beach.
